The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The intention is to style the paragraphs within the `#container` div differently from paragraphs elsewhere on the page. However, due to specificity rules, the `p` selector in the second rule overrides the first one.

```css
div#container p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```
